Memos (PARA)

This folder organizes working knowledge using the PARA method:
- Projects — Active, outcome-driven efforts.
- Areas — Ongoing responsibilities and standards.
- Resources — Reference materials and reusable knowledge.
- Archives — Inactive items kept for history.

How to use
- Write concise notes in plain markdown.
- Prefer one topic per file; link out when needed.
- Start with a 1–2 sentence purpose line to help retrieval.
