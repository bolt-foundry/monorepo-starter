Purpose
- Company-style handbook: authoritative, current, and stable.

Scope
- Policies, standards, canonical guides, onboarding, and how-tos that must stay up to date.

Conventions
- Plain markdown only. No frontmatter.
- Keep sections concise; link deeper details in `memos/` when context is evolving.
- Prefer normative language ("do", "must", "should").

Maintainer Notes
- Review periodically; update when processes change.
- If content becomes exploratory or time-bound, move it to `memos/` and link back here.
